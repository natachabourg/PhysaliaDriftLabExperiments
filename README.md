# PhysaliaDriftLabExperiments

This repository contains code supporting the publication titled "Investigating the wind effect on Physalia physalisâ€™ drift: insights from a lab-based experiment."

## Overview

The repository includes:

- **Calibrate_Camera:** This directory contains all the codes used to create the calibration matrix required for correcting image distortion captured by the camera.

- **TrackAndCalibrateTrajectories.ipynb:** This Jupyter notebook automates the process of identifying the positions of Physalia models in the images and calibrating their trajectories to determine their true angle and speed. It utilizes the calibration matrix generated in the previous step.

- **PlotAnalysis.ipynb:** This notebook is dedicated to generating the three main plots presented in the paper.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the `Calibrate_Camera` directory to create the calibration matrix.
2. Execute the `TrackAndCalibrateTrajectories.ipynb` notebook to automatically identify Physalia positions and calibrate their trajectories.
3. Utilize the `PlotAnalysis.ipynb` notebook to generate the primary plots for analysis.
